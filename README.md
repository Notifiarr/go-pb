# Go pb - Pastebin alternative written in Golang

[![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE.txt)

Yet another exercise in Go (the first one was [go-du](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-du).
This time it is a web app and an API that provides [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com)
alternative.
Obviously this project is a little bit more complicated and will take more time.

## Features

In no particular order:

 - Sharing snippets of text of arbitrary size (can be limited)
 - Burn (delete) after read or after certain time period
 - Private/public sharing
 - Require authentication to share
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Ability to create pastes from command line

This is only the beginning, more information is to come.
