Yet another exercise in Go (the first one was [go-du](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-du)).
This time it is a web app and an API that provides [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com)
alternative.
Obviously, this project is a little bit more complicated and will take more time.

âš **Warning**: this project is very much a work in progress. A lot of changes are
made regularly, including breaking changes. This is not a usable product yet!

## Features

In no particular order:

 - Sharing snippets of text of arbitrary size (can be limited)
 - Burn (delete) after reading or after a particular time
 - Private/public sharing
 - Require authentication to share
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Ability to create pastes from the command line

There is a [Roadmap](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb/projects/1) that we will
start filling up with features, issues and ideas.
