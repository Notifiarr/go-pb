# Contributing

First of all, we want to thank you for considering contributing to this
project. You are already awesome!

Below are a few guidelines to help you get
started. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and
when in doubt [Discussions](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb/discussions)
is the best place to ask questions.

This document is part of the project. If there is something wrong or you
want to propose a change, please do so in a pull request.

We welcome contributors of any level. If it is your first time contributing
to an Open Source project, you can learn how from this *free* series:

_This document is a work in progress. You may notice that some parts are empty_
_or incomplete. Please, be patient! It is a very young project. Alternatively,_
_you may consider contributing to this document. üòâ_

## What can I contribute?
At this point, anything! Here are some contributions that we will
gladly accept:
 - Ideas about how to do things better
 - Feature suggestions
 - Bug reports
 - Documentation improvements
 - Bug fixes
 - Feature implementation

## Feature suggestions
Before suggesting a feature, please have a look at the
[roadmap](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb/projects/1) to see if it's not
something we are working on already or plan to work on in the future.

The best way to suggest a new feature is to start a
[new discussion](https://github.com/iliafrenkel/go-pb/discussions/new). That
way, we will collect more details and see the community sentiment
before creating an actual issue.

## Bug reports
_Template TBD_

## How to set up the environment
_TBD_

## Code contributions
Before you submit any code for review, please consider the following:
- We want our code to run on any platform, make sure your change doesn't break
  cross-platform compatibility.
- Write tests for the code you are submitting and make sure that your tests
  pass and that existing tests don't fail either.
- Comment your code extensively!

Just a side note on licensing. If you bring an external dependency, consider
the license. This project is MIT licensed. For example GPL licensed code cannot
be included in this project without violating the GPL.

### Commit messages
We highly value commit messages that follow established forms within the
project. Generally speaking, we follow the practices
[outlined](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines)
in the Pro Git Book. A good commit message will look like the following:

 - Line 1: A short summary written in the present imperative tense. For example:
   * ‚úîÔ∏è Good: "Fix post rendering bug"
   * ‚ùå No: "Fixes post rendering bug"
   * ‚ùå No: "Fixing post rendering bug"
   * ‚ùå No: "Fixed post rendering bug"
   * ‚ùå No: "Post rendering bug is fixed now"
- Line 2: [left blank]
- Line 3: An added description of what changed, any rationale, etc. -- optional
- Last line: A mention of any applicable task or issue
   * For GitHub issues: Ref #000 or Fixes #000

### Code review
Once you submit a pull request, someone will have a look at it as soon as
possible. Generally within 48 hours. If the reviewer is happy, the pull request
will be merged. We may ask you some questions or suggest changes. Any pull
requests with pending questions will be closed after seven days of inactivity.
